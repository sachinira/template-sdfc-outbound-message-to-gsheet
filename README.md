# Template: Add Received Salesforce Outbound Message to Google Sheet row
When new Outbound Message is received from Salesforce, add new row to a Google Sheet.<br>

We can make our day-to-day information organized with the help of Google Sheets. But creating layouts and formatting a
sheet takes much more time than we think. By using this integration, we can organize and automatically set up a Google Sheet
which will contain information about exchanges Salesforce initiated with our callback endpoint.

This template can be used to create a new row in a specific Google Sheet when a new Outbound Message is received from 
Salesforce.

## Use this template to
- Add new row to a Google Sheet containing information in the Outbound Message received from Salesforce.
- Get away from manually tracking all the Outbound Messages received to the callback URL.

## What you need
- A Salesforce Account
- A Google Cloud Platform Account
- An `Outbound Message` which will be triggered by a `Workflow Rule`

## How to set up
- Import the template.
- Allow access to the Salesforce account.
- Select an outbound message.
- Set up a callback URL(webhook).
- Allow access to the Google account.
- Select spreadsheet.
- Select worksheet.
- Set up the template.

8. Visit https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/ 
    Go to settings (Top right corner) -> Tick 'Use your own OAuth credentials' and insert Oauth client ID and client secret. 
    Click close.

3. Get the ID of the spreadsheet.  
![alt text](docs/images/spreadsheet_id_example.png?raw=true)
5. Get the worksheet name.

6. Once you obtained all configurations, Create `Config.toml` in root directory.
7. Replace the necessary fields in the `Config.toml` file with your data.

### Config.toml 
```
[<ORG_NAME>.sdfc_outbound_msg_to_gsheet]
sheets_spreadsheet_id = "<SPREADSHEET_ID>"
sheets_worksheet_name = "<WORKSHEET_NAME>"
sheets_refresh_token = "<REFRESH_TOKEN>"
sheets_client_id = "<CLIENT_ID>"
sheets_client_secret = "<CLIENT_SECRET>"
``` 

## Running the Template

1. First you need to build the integration template and create the executable binary. Run the following command from the 
root directory of the integration template. 
`$ bal build`. 

2. Then you can run the integration binary with the following command. 
`$  bal run target/bin/sdfc_outbound_msg_to_gsheet-0.1.0.jar`. 

3. Now you can do actions which trigger the `Workflow Rule` that is linked to the `Outbound Message` and observe that integration template runtime has 
received the `POST` request to the callback URL specified in the outbound message.

4. You can check the Google Sheet to verify that a new row added containing information in the outbound message.
